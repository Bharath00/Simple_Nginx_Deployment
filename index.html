<h2>Deployment Vs ReplicaSets</h2>

<p>Deployment resource makes it easier for updating your pods to a newer version.

    Lets say you use ReplicaSet-A for controlling your pods, then You wish to update your pods to a newer version, now you should create Replicaset-B, scale down ReplicaSet-A and scale up ReplicaSet-B by one step repeatedly (This process is known as rolling update). Although this does the job, but it's not a good practice and it's better to let K8S do the job.
    
    A Deployment resource does this automatically without any human interaction and increases the abstraction by one level.
    
    Note: Deployment doesn't interact with pods directly, it just does rolling update using ReplicaSets</p>
